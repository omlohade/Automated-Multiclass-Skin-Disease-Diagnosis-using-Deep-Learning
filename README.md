Title: Automated Multiclass Skin Disease Diagnosis using Deep Learning

Description:
üåê Excited to share my latest project, an Automated Multiclass Skin Disease Diagnosis web application using Deep Learning! Leveraging the power of TensorFlow, this project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify skin diseases from images.

üìö **Key Steps:**
1. **Import Libraries:** TensorFlow is the backbone, along with essential modules for building and training the model.
   
2. **Set Constants:** Defined parameters like batch size, image size, channels, and training epochs.

3. **Load Dataset:** Utilized the image_dataset_from_directory function to seamlessly load, shuffle, and batch the skin disease dataset.

4. **Visualize Dataset:** Provided a glimpse of the dataset through visualization for thorough inspection.

5. **Split Dataset:** Thoughtfully divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring 80% for training and 10% each for validation and testing.

6. **Preprocess Dataset:** Optimized performance by caching, shuffling, and prefetching datasets for training, validation, and testing.

7. **Build Model:** Crafted a robust CNN model with layers for resizing and normalization.

8. **Data Augmentation:** Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization and performance.

9. **Apply Data Augmentation:** Successfully applied data augmentation techniques to the training dataset.

10. **Compile Model:** Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.

11. **Train Model:** Methodically trained the model on the training dataset, validating its performance at the end of each epoch.

12. **Evaluate Model:** Analyzed the model's performance using a dedicated test dataset.

13. **Save Model:** Secured the trained model to a specified directory for future use or deployment.
